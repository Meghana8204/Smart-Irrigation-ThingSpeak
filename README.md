# Smart-Irrigation-ThingSpeak
IoT-based smart irrigation system using soil moisture sensors and ThingSpeak cloud monitoring. 5th semester mini-project.

# 💧 Smart Irrigation System Using ThingSpeak

An IoT-based project built during my 5th semester to automate irrigation using **soil moisture sensors** and real-time data visualization through the **ThingSpeak cloud platform**. The system detects the moisture level of the soil and activates a water pump only when necessary, helping save water and improve farming efficiency.

## 🌱 Project Objective

To reduce water waste in agricultural fields by automatically controlling irrigation based on real-time soil moisture data, and enable remote monitoring using **ThingSpeak**.

---

## 🛠️ Components & Technologies Used

- **Arduino Uno** or **NodeMCU ESP8266**
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**
- **Relay Module**
- **DC Water Pump**
- **ThingSpeak API** (for cloud data logging)
- **Breadboard**, **Jumper wires**, **Power source**

---

## 🔁 How It Works

1. The soil moisture sensor measures the water level in the soil.
2. If the moisture is **below threshold**, the **water pump is automatically turned ON**.
3. Once moisture reaches the threshold, the pump is **turned OFF**.
4. Sensor data is sent to **ThingSpeak** for real-time monitoring and visualization from anywhere.
